## Landscape

The electronic trading platform industry is a competitive environment, Trumid's largest competitors are MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and Tradeweb Markets Inc. These three companies are pioneering the electronification of the corporate bond market and they are fighting for marketshare as their is significant potential for growth. Nearly three-quarters of the market still trades by phone, one of the last corners of finance to fully embrace the digital age.

## Results

Trumid has capitalized on what’s been a record period for corporate bond trading amid the pandemic-fueled volatility, posting 500% growth in volume in 2020. Much of that comes from its attributed trading protocol, in which each counterparty of a transaction is disclosed. That’s been growing through a partnership with Citigroup Inc. -- 14 dealers are currently streaming their liquidity, and Trumid expects that to grow to 20 by year-end. Market participants believe that bond trading is on the verge of a dramatic shift towards electronic trading, which will drive greater liquidity and efficiency for buy-side and sell-side traders. Trumid is effectively positioned to capture market share in this industry.
